# Multilingual-Q-A-Bot-for-College-Website-using-BERT
**The proposed system is a multilingual chatbot that uses  pre-trained BERT model for question answering that is fine-tuned on a labeled dataset in English language consisting of context, questions and answers, and will be created using the data from college website. The chatbot is made multilingual by incorporating translation module. The  query (if present in a language other than English) by user is translated to English using the translation module . The translated English query is given as an input to fine-tuned model which gives output a span of answer text from the context which is again translated back to the user language.**
